Context (simplified)
We operate two mobile apps (React Native with Expo), on iOS and Android:
Responder App
• Location tracking
• Regular location updates to the backend
• Receiving incidents (including data + location)
• Navigation to the target
• Incident report once the issue is resolved
User App
• Notification when an alarm is triggered
• Disable alarms
• Trigger a “mobile panic”
Problem
We occasionally see the Responder App stops sending location updates. The root cause is unclear: it could be a software bug, but it could also be poor connectivity, connection drops, or OS background restrictions.
We need to ensure that we reliably know where our responders are - and, equally important, detect when a responder is not reachable, so that we don’t accidentally assign an incident to someone who may not receive it.
Assignment
Please propose an architecture for a “permanent location update” feature (Responder App + backend). The focus should be on robustness, detectability of failures, resource efficiency, and a design that realistically works on both iOS and Android (React Native + Expo).
Requirements / Guiding Questions
1) Mobile App (Client)
• How would you structure location collection and sending (components, states, data flow)?
• How would you deal with background execution and OS constraints on iOS and Android?
• How would you ensure updates are resource-efficient?
• e.g. every X seconds or only when movement exceeds Y meters (feel free to propose reasonable defaults)
• What should happen in the following situations:
• App in background / app killed / OS stops background tasks
• Permission changes / location services disabled
• Battery saver / low power mode
• Flaky or missing connectivity (offline, captive portals, Wi-Fi ↔ cellular switching)
• What telemetry/logging would you generate on the device (minimal and privacy-aware)?
2) Backend
• How would you determine reliability and “liveness” of a responder?
• e.g. heartbeats, expected update intervals, tolerances, state models (“online”, “degraded”, “offline”)
• What monitoring and alerting would you implement?
• How would you detect missing updates and react to them?
• e.g. server-side heuristics, escalation, reassignment rules, optional ping/ack mechanisms
• What should the backend not do, in order to avoid unnecessary complexity?
3) Incident Delegation / Product Logic
• How would you prevent incidents from being assigned to responders who are likely unreachable?
• Which decisions belong to the backend vs. the app?
• What UX or signals would you give to responders (e.g. “connectivity degraded”)?
4) Cross-Platform / React Native + Expo
• Please explicitly state assumptions and constraints related to React Native + Expo:
• What would you solve using Expo APIs?
• Where would you plan native modules or configuration changes if needed?
• What pragmatic steps would you take if Expo limitations reduce reliability?
Deliverables
1) Design Memo (1–2 pages, e.g. Markdown or Google Doc)
Suggested structure:
• Problem statement, goals, and non-goals
• Proposed architecture (mobile + backend), diagram optional
• Failure modes and mitigations
• Observability (telemetry, monitoring)
• Trade-offs (battery vs. accuracy vs. reliability vs. complexity)
• Rollout / migration strategy (incremental, no big bang)
• Open questions and assumptions
2) Short Loom Video (5–8 minutes)
Please walk us through your approach:
• How did you think about the problem?
• Which decisions are most critical, and why?
• What would you validate next (tests, experiments, metrics)?
Time Frame
• Please plan 2–3 hours for the memo (video is additional but short).
• Submission ideally by Friday 23.01. COB
Evaluation Criteria (for transparency)
We will primarily evaluate:
• Structured reasoning and explicit assumptions
• Realistic handling of mobile constraints (iOS/Android background behavior)
• Robustness (failure modes, recovery, detectability)
• Resource efficiency (battery, network)
• Observability: how would we reliably detect and diagnose the issue?
• Incremental, practical implementation strategy
